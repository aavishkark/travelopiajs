# AboutTask

On Header I provided some dummy links. I used button tag instead of a tag because it is advised to not use a tag when there are no actual href urls given to them. I used display property to get all the buttons spread in single line with equal gap between them the height of the header is 100px as it was asked in assignment document. I chose dark blue color because its seemed soothing to eyes and goes along with the background image and the whole theme of the page.To make the header responsive i used media query property of css. On Screen size less than equal to 400px the buttons will be hidden and the hamburgur icon will be visible on the header.I also added some transition to the header such as when page loads for the first time the links will float from top to bottom and settle in middle of the header.I used Chakra ui icons for the hamburger Icon.

 The middle Section has a container with overflow set to hidden to make sure that when the dimensions are changed it does not affect the display of background image. I used img tag to set the background image and used position property to fix its position and the z-index. I set the dimension of image to 100%.The image covers the entire container.I used background-color and its alpha value to get the overlay and gave it z-index value greater than the image so that it sits on top and covers the image completely.The .title container is used to display the title and click here button. It has z-index greater than overlay. When Click here button is is clicked the alert opens with a transition.I used a flag boolean variable to dynamically change the display properties of both alert container and title container.I used some tansitions on button hover to make the page look responsive to the actions of the user.

 Finally the footer, It has same background color and height as the header. I used Copyright © 2024 Travelopia. All rights reserved. as a filler text.
